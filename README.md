# Object Visualizer

I am great fan of Data Visualization, I always wanted to see how any 
other object observe things with respect to there height.
Like An Elephant Vision, just imagine how we appears in there eyes.

### About
This is an **Object** **Visualizer** and it shows you images which a object
identifies with respect to it's size and distance 
between object and the wall(or any other object).

### Utilized
Concept of Ray Casting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, p5.js Library and Material Design Lite.
