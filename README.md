# ObjectVisualizer

I am great fan of data visualization, I always wanted to see how any 
other object observe things with respect to there height.
like An Elephant Vision, just imagine how we apper in there eyes.

This is an Object Visualizer and it shows you images which a object
identify with respect to it's size and distance 
between object and the wall(or any other object).

This app is hosted here: https://prateek-pixels.github.io/ObjectVisualizer/

How to use: 
1. For forward and Backword direction use mouse
2. For left direction use <- Arrow Button
3. For right direction use -> Arrow Button.

Utilized: Concept of Ray Casting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, p5.js Library and Material Design Lite.
