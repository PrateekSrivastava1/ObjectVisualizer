# ObjectVisualizer

I am great fan of Data Visualization, I always wanted to see how any 
other object observe things with respect to there height.
like An Elephant Vision, just imagine how we apper in there eyes.

This is an **Object** **Visualizer** and it shows you images which a object
identify with respect to it's size and distance 
between object and the wall(or any other object).

Utilized: Concept of Ray Casting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, p5.js Library and Material Design Lite.

This app is hosted here: [Object Visualizer](https://prateek-pixels.github.io/ObjectVisualizer/)

How to use: 
1. For forward and Backword direction use mouse
2. For left direction use <- Arrow Button
3. For right direction use -> Arrow Button.
